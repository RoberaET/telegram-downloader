   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd telegram-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up configuration**
   - Your bot token is already configured in `config.py`
   - If you need to change it, edit the `config.py` file:
   ```python
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
   ```

## Getting Your Telegram Bot Token

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the instructions to create your bot
4. Copy the token provided by BotFather
5. Paste it in your `config.py` file

## Usage

1. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

2. **In Telegram**
   - Find your bot by the username you created
   - Send `/start` to begin
   - Send a TikTok video URL to download the video

## Supported URL Formats

- `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567890`
- `https://vm.tiktok.com/xxxxx/`
- `https://vt.tiktok.com/xxxxx/`

## Configuration Options

You can customize the bot behavior by modifying the `config.py` file:

```python
# Telegram Bot Token (required)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"

# Maximum file size for downloads (in bytes, default: 50MB)
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 52428800

# Download timeout (in seconds, default: 5 minutes)
DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 300
```

## Bot Commands

- `/start` - Show welcome message and bot information
- `/help` - Display detailed usage instructions

## How It Works

1. **URL Validation**: The bot checks if the provided URL is a valid TikTok URL
2. **Video Info Extraction**: Uses `yt-dlp` to extract video information
3. **Download**: Downloads the video in the best available quality
4. **File Size Check**: Ensures the downloaded file doesn't exceed size limits
5. **Send to User**: Sends the video back to the user via Telegram
6. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes the downloaded file from the server

## Error Handling

The bot handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid TikTok URLs
- Private or unavailable videos
- Network connectivity issues
- File size limitations
- Download timeouts
